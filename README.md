# Data Product Portal

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conveyordata/data-product-portal/main/images/screenshot.png)

## Introduction

The Data Product Portal enables companies to build data products in a self-service manner, enabling the creation of data
products across all departments and domains within an organization. It introduces simple but powerful concepts that
are easy to understand and extensible to various types of data platform implementations. The portal is a process tool
that helps data professionals while providing governance and insights into how data is being used throughout the
organization.

Unlike traditional data catalogs that primarily focus on describing data, the Data Product Portal guides you through
the entire data product development lifecycle. This includes self-service and secure access to tools, data platforms,
data sources, and sharing concepts, ensuring control and oversight for business stakeholders.

Our goal is to bridge the gap between data governance, data platforms and data catalogs and provide a 360 view of all
ongoing data initiatives that is easy to understand by everybody.

## Who is it for?

The Data Product Portal is designed for data teams within businesses that aim to build their own use cases in a
self-service way, embracing data product thinking. It automates many of the onboarding steps required to start building
data platforms.

While the portal is technology-agnostic and can integrate with various clouds, tools, and datasets, it requires initial
support from your data platform team for installation and integration. We offer several standard integrations at launch
and plan to extend these over time.

If your organization has only one data team or a limited number of use cases, the data product portal might not be
something for you. With the data product portal we aim to help organisations that want to scale building data products
by offering self-service capabilities.

## Concepts

The Data Product Portal guides product teams through the data product life cycle, considering all governance aspects
required by modern organizations. It introduces several key concepts:

### Data Products

A data product is a scoped data initiative with a clear goal, led by a data product owner. The owner manages the team,
requests access to datasets, and follows a governed, standardized, and compliant process tailored to the organization’s
needs. All access, tooling, and interactions are configured at the data product level, ensuring safe and isolated
development.

### Users

Users are individuals who work on a data product in specific roles, gaining access to tools and data sources based on
their roles. They perform various actions such as interacting with data, releasing pipelines, and merging pull requests.
Users can work on multiple data products but must choose which one they are working on at any given time, ensuring data
is used in the right context.

### Datasets

Datasets group one or more data objects and are the level at which read data access is granted to a data product.
Dataset owners, typically business-related individuals, approve access to specific data products. Access is granted to
data products rather than users, guaranteeing that data is used only for the approved scope.

### Data Objects

Data objects are outputs of a data product, such as files, tables, or topics. They are associated with a data product
that has full read and write permissions. Data objects are never directly shared unless they are part of a dataset,
allowing safe development until they are ready for organizational sharing.

## Benefits

Adopting the Data Product Portal offers several benefits:
- **Guided Setup:** Step-by-step assistance involving the right stakeholders for creating data products, requesting
access, adding users and registering new data for sharing with other data products.
- **Tech Translation:** Converts high-level concepts into specific configurations settings for platforms like AWS,
Azure, Databricks, Snowflake, and others, making sure that each data product is correctly separated and not impacting
each other.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Makes it easy for business users and people working with data to understand and navigate
the data landscape.
- **Self-service:** Enables departments and teams to start new data initiatives easily without having to depend on a
central team. 
- **Comprehensive Overview:** Combines data catalogs, data platforms and data governance aspects into a single 360
overview of all ongoing data initiatives.

# Getting Started

## Local Sandbox

### Prerequisites

#### Docker

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.

### Installation
- Ensure your Docker service is running.

- In order to set up a local 'production-like' server with a connection to a database, run the command below in the root of this project.
  ```sh
  docker compose up
  ```

- If you want to make sure recent changes in the repository are reflected, run the command below instead.
  ```sh
  docker compose up --build
  ```
- Now visit http://localhost:8080 to check it out!

### Sample Data
While running in sandbox mode, the Portal will be automatically seeded with sample data (incl. users, data products, datasets, ...). The source of this data can be found in the [sample_data.sql](./backend/sample_data.sql) file.
If you want to see different data in the sandbox mode, you can either modify this file or create your custom data file and reference that one in the [compose.yaml](compose.yaml) instead of the 'sample_data.sql' file. See the comments to learn how to pass a local file to that container.

### Limitations

The default local sandbox is [configured](.env.docker) to *disable OAuth* and to *disable AWS calls*. This allows for a
very easy first-time setup that will give you a quick overview of the functionality the Data Product Portal provides. If
you want to explore additional technical integrations, more setup is required (see below).

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

#### Pre-commit hooks
It is recommended that you enable the pre-commit hooks the moment you start contributing to the project.

- Install pre-commit ([pip](https://pre-commit.com) / [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pre-commit)) on your machine.
- Run the command below in the root of this project.
```sh
pre-commit install
  ```
