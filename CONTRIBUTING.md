# Contributing to the Data Product Portal

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Data Product Portal! It's people like you that make this such a great community. We welcome any and all contributions and are excited to see what you'll bring to the project.

To ensure a welcoming and friendly environment, we have a **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** that all contributors, committers, and users must adhere to. Please take a moment to read it before you get started.

For a great introduction to the project, the best place to start is our **[README](README.md)** file.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing code and improving documentation to submitting bug reports and feature requests.

* **üêõ Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please first search our [open issues](https://github.com/conveyordata/data-product-portal/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, create a new issue with a clear title and a detailed description of the problem.
* **‚ú® Suggesting Enhancements:** If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue to start a discussion. This allows us to align on the proposal before you invest your time in development.
* **üìù Documentation:** We always need help improving our documentation. If you find something unclear or missing, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request with your suggested changes.
* **üíª Code Contributions:** You can help by writing code to fix bugs or implement new features. Please follow the development process outlined below.

## Our Development Process

As we grow, we are adopting a development process inspired by The Apache Software Foundation to ensure transparency and collaboration. The core idea is to **discuss before you code**.

1.  **Find or Create an Issue:** All work should be tracked in a GitHub issue. Browse our [existing issues](https://github.com/conveyordata/data-product-portal/issues) to find something to work on. If you want to work on something new, please create a new issue first.
2.  **Claim an Issue:** Comment on the issue to let others know you are working on it.
3.  **Discuss Your Approach:** For any non-trivial change, it is important to discuss your proposed solution in the issue. This helps ensure that your contribution will be accepted and aligned with the project's direction.

## Proposing Major Architectural Changes

Before starting work on a **large feature or significant architectural change**, it is mandatory to first present a design proposal. This prevents wasted effort and ensures that the core team is aligned with your vision.

The process is as follows:

1.  **Create an Issue:** Open a GitHub issue with a title that clearly describes the proposed change (e.g., "Architecture Proposal: [Your Feature]").
2.  **Describe the Architecture:** In the issue description, provide a detailed write-up of your proposed architecture. This should include:
    * The **motivation** and problem you are solving.
    * A high-level **design overview**.
    * Details on how it affects different parts of the application.
    * Any potential **risks or drawbacks**.
3.  **Review by Committers:** Tag the project's committers in the issue. **The project committers are committed to reviewing these proposals in a timely manner.** Implementation should only begin after the proposed architecture has been discussed and has received approval from at least one project committer.

## Pull Request Process

We follow a "Review Then Commit" workflow. All contributions are made via Pull Requests (PRs).

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create a fork of the `data-product-portal` repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch from `main` for your changes. Please use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `feature/new-auth-module` or `fix/login-bug-123`).
3.  **Develop Locally:** Make your changes, ensuring you follow the project's coding style. Make sure to add or update tests as appropriate.
4.  **Commit Your Changes:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Reference the issue number in your commit messages (e.g., `feat: Add OAuth2 support (#123)`).
5.  **Run Tests:** Before submitting a PR, ensure that the full test suite passes locally.
6.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository.
    * In the PR description, link to the issue you are resolving (e.g., "Closes #123").
    * Provide a clear summary of the changes you have made.
7.  **Address Feedback:** A project committer will review your PR. They may ask for changes or provide suggestions. Please address the feedback and push your changes to the same branch.
8.  **Merging:** Once the PR is approved by a committer and all automated checks have passed, it will be merged into the `main` branch.

Congratulations! üéâ Your contribution is now part of the project. We truly appreciate your effort and dedication.
