# Data Product Portal Provider

The Data Product Portal provider is used to interact with a [Data Product Portal](https://github.com/conveyordata/data-product-portal) instance. It allows you to manage domains, data products, output ports, tags, and data product types.

## Authentication

The provider requires a base URL and an API key to authenticate with the Data Product Portal API.
