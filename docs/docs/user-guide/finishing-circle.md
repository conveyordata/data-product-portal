# The Final Step

We can now create and manage new **Data Products** using **Datasets**

### Using Datasets in New Data Products

Once you have datasets available, you can use them as **inputs** for creating new data products.
This allows you to build on top of existing data and extend its usage within your organization.

### How to Use Datasets in a Data Product

1. **Find your Data Product**: Either create a new Data Product like before, or navigating to an existing one.
2. **Select Input Datasets**: From the detailed **Data Product** page, go to the **Input Datasets** tab.
3. **Request Access**: Press **Add Dataset** and identify the right **Dataset**. Depending on the access type you will see either **Add Dataset** (for *public* datasets) or **Request Access** (for *restricted* datasets).
4. **Approval**: Once access has been requested, either approve it yourself if you are the owner, or wait until someone has approved your request.
Approvals are done from the **Consuming Data Products** tab from a **Dataset** detailed page.
