## What is the difference between a Data Product and an Output Port?

Think of the difference as "The Why" versus "The How".

#### The Data Product (The "Why"):

This represents the logical scope, value, and ownership.
A Data Product exists because there is a specific business use case (e.g., a Customer Recommendation Engine)
that requires its own lifecycle, unique logic, and a dedicated owner who understands that specific domain.
It is the "container" that holds the value.

#### The Output Port (The "How"):

This represents the consumption contract.
It is the mechanism users use to access the value inside the product.
A single Data Product can have multiple output ports to meet consumers where they are.
Adding a port does not change the underlying business logic;
it simply makes the data easier to consume (e.g., offering the same data via SQL for analysts and via API for applications).

## When should I create a new Data Product instead of adding an Output Port?

If you are unsure whether to expand an existing product or build a new one, use this rule of thumb:

#### Add an Output Port if:

- **The logic is identical**: You are serving the exact same data but simply need a different "wrapper" or format.

- **The ownership is the same:** The current product owner is still responsible for the data quality.

- *Example:* You have a customer table, and a new user needs that exact same data as a real-time stream or a flattened view for a specific BI tool.

#### Create a new Data Product if:

- **The logic changes:** You are performing complex feature engineering, aggregating data, or joining it with data from other domains to create new insights.

- **The ownership changes:** The transformation requires knowledge or management that sits with a different team.

- *Example:* You need to take the customer table and join it with third-party market data to predict churn risk. Because this involves new logic and joins irrelevant to the original customer data owner, this deserves to be its own Consumer-Aligned Data Product.

## What is a "Source-Aligned" vs. "Consumer-Aligned" Data Product?

This distinction is about where the data comes from versus how it is used.

#### Source-Aligned:

These products represent the facts of the business as they happen.
They are usually close to the operational systems (e.g., "Orders," "Website Clicks," "Invoices").
They are general-purpose and used by many different teams.

#### Consumer-Aligned:

These products are built to answer specific business questions.
They often combine data from multiple Source-Aligned products to create new value
(e.g., "Customer 360", "Quarterly Sales Forecast", "Fraud Detection").
