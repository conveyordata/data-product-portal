## ✨ Types of Contributions

### 🐞 Issues

Issues help us track bugs, feature requests, and general improvements.

- If an issue has the `triage` label, it hasn't been reviewed yet—please wait before starting work on it.
- You can search for existing issues on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/conveyordata/data-product-portal/issues).

### 🌐 Translations

The application is internationalized and supports multiple languages.

All source content is in English. To add support for a new language, follow the instructions in the [Frontend documentation](./frontend#add-new-languages).

### 🔧 Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) are used to propose code changes.

You can open a PR to:
- Resolve an existing issue

## 🛠️ Making Changes

### 1. Fork the Repository

Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.

### 2. Set Up Local Development

Follow the [development setup guide](./README.md#local-development) to prepare your environment.

### 3. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch from `main`. Use separate branches for unrelated changes to keep pull requests focused and manageable.

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Make your changes and commit them using clear and descriptive commit messages. Aim for each commit to represent a single, complete change.

---

## 🔄 Submitting a Pull Request

When you're ready:

1. Push your branch and open a pull request to the main repository.
2. Link your PR to any related issue using GitHub's `closes #issue-number` syntax.
3. Your PR will automatically trigger tests—only PRs that pass all checks will be considered for merging.
4. A project committer will review your changes and may suggest improvements, request documentation, or directly amend the PR to help.

> 🛠️ If you run into merge conflicts, follow this [GitHub tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to resolve them.

### During Review

- Apply any requested changes in your fork.
- Mark review conversations as **resolved** once addressed.
