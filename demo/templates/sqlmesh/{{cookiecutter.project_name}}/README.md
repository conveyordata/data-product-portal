# SQLMesh Data Product: {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

This data product has been scaffolded by the Data Product Portal provisioner.

## What's included

- `models/` - Your SQL models for SQLMesh
- `config.yaml` - SQLMesh configuration (uses DuckDB by default)
- `.env` - S3 credentials and configuration (generated by provisioner)

## Getting Started

1. Install SQLMesh:
   ```bash
   pip install sqlmesh
   ```

2. Verify your configuration:
   ```bash
   sqlmesh info
   ```

3. Create your first model in `models/`:
   ```sql
   MODEL (
     name my_schema.my_model,
     kind FULL
   );

   SELECT 1 as id, 'test' as name;
   ```

4. Plan and apply changes:
   ```bash
   sqlmesh plan
   sqlmesh run
   ```

## S3 Integration

Your S3 credentials are stored in `.env`. The provisioner has:
- Created a namespace in S3: `data-products/{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}`
- Generated access credentials
- Configured the endpoint

Access your S3 bucket at: `${S3_ENDPOINT}/data-products/${S3_PREFIX}`
